We ensure that the values are lived out so that they are not just taught but caught. It is not enough to be honest but exhibit integrity - the moral courage to speak up or own up when something wrong has been committed; everyone must be responsible to his own work; we allow mistakes to be made so that they build resilience and when they are successful, to always remember those who are less advantaged than them and show compassion by contributing back to Society. <br /><br />In NSPS we constantly build our teacher capacity through adopting a school-wide model of 'The Skillful Teacher'. We encourage our teachers to try different strategies so that they engage the children and bring about the 'joy of learning'.

Leadership trainings are customized at class level and for upper primary students. They apply the leadership skills in their role as P5 buddy to new P1 students. Students who show greater aptitude are identified and further developed via additional leadership training and workshops to sharpen their leadership competencies.  With such skills set, they will be able to initiate action amongst peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others. With a greater ownership of the learning experiences, they will find the learning even more meaningful and likely be motivated to want to make a difference to the community.<br />c) Character Education: The school sustains its positive school culture by adopting two school-wide approaches: Firstly, 'Learn Through Play' is a school-based programme anchored on the school's belief that students learn best during play and students are guided by trained staff to manage their emotions and actions when interacting with others. Secondly, the school adopts Restorative Practices to guide students to reflect on their actions and consequences so that they take responsibility for their actions and learn to care for others. Through these key approaches, the school has enhanced the social well-being of the students."
